# Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticles for Cytosolic Delivery of Therapeutic Macromolecules

## Description

This repository contains the necessary script and associated data to conduct the alpha helical peptide database screen performed to identify the endosomal escape peptides (EEPs) described in the paper "Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticles for Cytosolic Delivery of Therapeutic Macromolecules".

## Contents

### Scripts
* elp-eep_discovery.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis pipeline

### Data
* CPPTrainingData.xlsx: Dataset used for training the first generation linear regression model. Data was derived from "Guay, D., DELâ€™GUIDICE, T. & LEPETIT-STOFFAES, J.-P. Polypeptide-based shuttle agents for improving the transduction efficiency of polypeptide cargos to the cytosol of target eukaryotic cells, uses thereof, methods and kits relating to same. (2016)"
* AHDB.xlsx: Alpha helical peptide database compiled from (1) the [Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD)](https://aps.unmc.edu/), (2) Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP), (3) Therapeutic Peptide Design database (TP-DB). Filtering criteria for selection of peptides from these databases for inclusion into the AHDB is described in the methods of the paper.
